# Tweet-Sentiment-Extraction

In this Competetion, we need to predict the sentence or phrase that best supports the sentiment.
The Dataset is collected from - https://www.kaggle.com/c/tweet-sentiment-extraction

I have approched this problem using 3 different types of model

1) LSTM
2) BiLSTM
3) RoBERTA
Final pipeline was build using Sreamlit.
